Group Project Log
06/16/2020
We have completed our SRS Document and made diagrams for the following:
-	The UML diagram
-	The Class diagram
-	The Sequence Diagram
We have collaborated and split up the work based on who was interested in which aspects of the project.
I, Mohammed Abbas, have joined with two other members of my group to do the Client portion of the project.
We have made a GitHub account and made a repository to collect all of our future work.
